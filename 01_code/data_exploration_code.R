# DATA: 
# 'trends_up_to_....csv': These are files generated using Google Trends. 
  # They are the Google Trends index for each keyword for the given 'monthorweek'. 
  # Each keyword (indexed with 'keynum') is selected to be reflective of a university in the United States, 
  # given by 'schname'. Multiple files. 
# 'Most+Recent+Cohorts+(Scorecard+Elements).csv': 
  # This is data from the College Scorecard, a simple dataset that contains lots of information about 
  # United States colleges and the students that graduate from them. The variable names arenâ€™t super helpful 
  # but they are documented in CollegeScorecardDataDictionary-09-08-2015.csv
# CollegeScorecardDataDictionary-09-08-2015.csv: variable definition guide for
  # 'Most+Recent+Cohorts+(Scorecard+Elements).csv'
# 'id_name_link.csv': which can be used to match colleges as identified in the Scorecard data 
  # (by 'unitid' and 'opeid' / 'UNITID' and 'OPEID') with colleges as identified in the Google Trends data 
  # (by 'schname'). The join functions will be helpful (see help(join) after loading the tidyverse)

# IMPORTANT: subtract the mean and divide by standard deviation
  # drop all dups on 'schname'

# DELIVERABLES:
  # produce at least 1 regression
  # produce at least 1 graph
  # conclusion based on results

# Things to think about: 
  # where is the line drawn between "high-earning" vs. "low-earning" colleges?
  # what level should the analysis be at? use group_by() and summarize() to change levels
  # type of regression model, how to interpret, and WHY!????
